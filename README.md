# Triangles

#  Program that has multiple mathematical equations n\
# to calculate the problem based on the option selected \n
#
# The first part of the program indicates the MENU options \n
#
# The next part has all the functions from the MENU \n
# options. This is where the calculations are made for \n
# each menu option
#
# The main function is where the user enters a while loop \n
# which prompts the user to enter an option from the MENU
#
# If the user enters a valid option, the program will \n
# run the code corresponding to that option
#
# If the user enters an invalid option, the program will \n
# print an error and prompt the user to enter a valid option
#
# The program will continue to run until the user selects \n
# option "X" or "x", which will then print "Thank you for playing"
